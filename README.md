Idea
---------
Learning new programming language for programmers is very easy but because of generality in books and courses they are boring.
You need something faster to reach your goal.
I had worked for years with C and C++ older versions and when I decide to learn c++ newer syntax I have difficulty in chooseing 
convenient resources. At end I choose a course that is not complete but I decide to learn it by examples and searching for everything
that is new in internet. I learnt from diffrent sites and courses and collect samples to remind myself every new feature in c++ 11.
Then I say myself why not to share it with others that know C or C++ older syntax and want to learn new versios fast.
These examples are not complete but I think they are enough for starting and we can together get it better.
